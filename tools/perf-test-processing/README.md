# @fluid-tools/perf-test-processing

Internal tool to process the output of our performance benchmark tests and write relevant metrics to our monitoring
systems.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

This tool leverages [oclif](https://oclif.io/). To run it manually, you need to call oclif's `run` script in the `bin`
folder, like so:

```bash
node bin/run <arguments to the tool>
```

The tool expects an argument for the type of test that it's going to be processing, and one or more arguments for
folders that contain the test output files (generated by the `@fluid-tools/benchmark` tool when called with the
appropriate options to generate output JSON files).

To see all arguments and expected usage run `node bin/run --help`.

The `start` npm script can be used as an alternative to `node bin/run`, with an extra separator for the arguments, like
so:

```bash
npm run start -- <arguments to the tool>
```

Make sure that the files in the folders you specify and the test type matcth (i.e. run with `--testType executionTime`
and folders that contain output files for execution-time tests, or `--testType memoryUsage` and folders that contain
output files for memory usage tests).
