# @fluid-tools/perf-test-processing

Internal tool to process the output of our performance benchmark tests and write relevant metrics to our monitoring
systems.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

Run the tool. The first argument should be the specific script within the tool that you want to run, and the rest
of the arguments should be one or more folders that contain performance test output files generated by
the `@fluid-tools/benchmark` tool (when called with the appropriate options to generate output JSON files). E.g.:

```bash
node dist/processExecutionTimeTests.js '/workspaces/FluidFramework/experimental/dds/tree/benchOutput' '/workspaces/FluidFramework/packages/dds/tree/benchOutput'
```

Make sure that the files in those folders correspond to the script you're running (i.e. run `processExecutionTimeTests.js`
with folders that contain output files for execution-time tests, and `processMemoryTests.js` with folders that contain
output files for memory usage tests).
